# Customer Churn Prediction in R

## Project Overview
This ongoing project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications sector using supervised learning techniques in R. 
The model is being developed using the **Cell2Cell churn dataset** from Kaggle, containing over **71,000 records** with 58 attributes. 
The primary focus is on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building robust predictive models.

## Project Workflow:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Cleaning and normalizing data for improved model accuracy.  
   - Performing feature engineering to identify significant predictors.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzing customer behavior and usage patterns linked to churn.  
   - Visualizing key insights.  

3. **Model Development (Ongoing):**  
   - Building and evaluating supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests).  
   - Comparing model performance and assessing generalization.  

## Current Status:
- Completed EDA and data cleaning.
- Advanced data analysis and  ETL processes are in progress.
- Model training and evaluation are also in progress.  

## Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language:** R  
- **Libraries:** dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, caret, glmnet  
- **Visualization:** ggplot2, plotly  
- **Data Source:** Kaggle - Cell2Cell Churn Dataset
